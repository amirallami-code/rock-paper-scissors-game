# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

**Rock, Paper, Scissors** is a classic hand game that has been played for generations. It's a simple yet entertaining way to make quick decisions or settle disputes. Here's how you can play:

1. **Players**: The game is typically played by two people, but variations exist for more players.

2. **Rules**:
    - Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:
        - **Rock** (a fist)
        - **Paper** (an open hand)
        - **Scissors** (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)
    - The possible outcomes are:
        - **Rock crushes scissors**
        - **Scissors cut paper**
        - **Paper covers rock**
    - If both players choose the same shape, it's a tie, and the round is replayed.

3. **Gameplay**:
    - Players start each round by saying "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot."
    - On "Shoot," both players reveal their chosen shape.
    - Determine the winner based on the rules above.
    - Keep track of wins and play multiple rounds to declare an overall winner.

4. **Technologies**:
    - To create a digital version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, you can use a combination of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (JS)**:
        - **HTML**: Create the structure of the game, including buttons for rock, paper, and scissors.
        - **CSS**: Style the buttons and layout.
        - **JS**: Add interactivity by handling button clicks, determining the winner, and updating the score.
